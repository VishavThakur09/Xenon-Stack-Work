## Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
This is an online web application as a feature to an existing recipe website. Its purpose is to engage and give the users an additional tool in using the recipe data and mantain a community around the existing site. Making food interesting, unique and fun is hard. With a tool to help plan your meals can help reduce stress and create a great community. 

## Demo <a name="demo"></a>

## Features <a name="features"></a>
Transcript for the demonstration. We will go through  each features of the application as a user and how I accomplish these through code. 

## Sign-up & Login  <a name="sign-in"></a>

Sign up for the application is managed mostly on the backend. With user validations / Bcrypt / and JWT tokens. Front end validations are mostly form validation i.e password, char length etc. 

The validations and db constraints will send a message back if they are activated. Those messages will be rendered as helper text on the text area. 

![sign up validation](src/img/signup-validator.gif)

[Sign-Up Code](src/features/routes/SignUp.js)

On the front end I have a slice of my Redux store dedicated purely to my sessions. This will control a global loggedIn status that is dependent on a JWT token being in local storage.


![login extra reducer](src/img/login-reducer.png)

[Login Code](src/features/routes/Login.js)

 Honestly it could look like a JWT token to make it pass the private routing but the content is validated on the backend with each fetch and no private content will render without authorization. 

### Authentification <a name="auth"></a>

>The jwt is kept in the Auth headers and validated on the backend 

![session fetch](src/img/session-fetch.png)

[Session Fetch Code](src/features/session/sessionSlice.js)

When logging in the actions are: storing the jwt in local storage, iniate a counter in local storage and initiate a brief history in sessions so if there is a refresh my program will know where it is at and what content to render. This is using React Router useLocation hook, striped to pathname and then I can render based on conditionals. This will be shown later.[^1] [^2]

![Jwt login gif](src/img/login-jwt.gif)

[Login Code](src/features/routes/Login.js)

>It was a purposeful design decision to name this slice 'sessions' as it is the title of my controller on my backend. I follow the DUCK directory design used in Redux Toolkit but name the files in the feature folders to follow along with the rails naming convention for views that mimic controller actions. i.e. index/show/edit etc. This is a field of interest for me improving and expanding upon. [^3]

## Dashboard  <a name="dashboard"></a>
When you are authorized login or sign-up you are taken to the user dashboard, quiet tasteful if I might say. As a new user you do not have any meal plans but you do have a set of instructions that guide the new user on how to make new meal plans. This can be increased with additional pointers and guides.

![blank dashboard](src/img/blank-dashboard.png)
[Dashboard Code](src/features/session/Dashboard.js)
>I do enjoy the minimalist timeline feel though. 


As you follow the instructions you can create a new meal plan. 
![new meal plan](src/img/new-meal-plan.gif)

[Dashboard Code](src/features/session/Dashboard.js)

 The meal plan is instanciated empty of course and the user is prompted to find inspiration through recipes and other user's meal plans. So let's go see other user's plans. 


![empty plan alert](src/img/empty-plan-alert.png)
[Dashboard Code](src/features/session/Dashboard.js)
## Meal Plans  <a name="meal-plans"></a>

The initial page for exploring meal plans will hold all of the user's meal plans. Paginating this and creating keyword searches could be easily implemented and are already features for the individual recipe search. 

![explore meal plans](src/img/mealplan-index.gif)

[Meal Plan Index](src/features/plans/PlansIndex.js)

The meals have a horizontal scroll bar on the excerpt display card. 

You can see how I impolemented that here: 
[Horizontal Scroll](src/features/plans/PlanExcerpt.js)

This is not the best user experience as the scroll pad can easily make the browser go back and it is not a natural feel.

This was a design decision based on variety. I wanted to display a different excerpt card than the one on the dashboard that we will see later. 

We can use the button on the cared to follow it to the meal plan recipe display page, where you can see previews for each recipe that belongs to the meal plan. 

**Additional features** would include being able to 'flavorite' a meal plan as a reference to a meal plan you really enjoy. 


**Before we more on** Let us take a look on how we are going to be navigating in the application. 

## Navigation and Routes  <a name="nvr"></a>
This section is split into two sections, the navigation in the application using the drawer buttons and how the routing is set up. 

### Routing <a name="routing"></a>
I am using React Router v.5.2 which is the latest version and I take advantage of their great hooks. 

I leveraged React's power of composition to create private routes and public routes. 

I created a routes object that stores the component to be rendered and the route that triggers that render. 

![route object](src/img/route-obj.gif)

[Routes](src/features/routes/routes.js)

This will allow me to create a private route by simply adding a component and route name to the object. I love React composition! 

This allows my app file to remain simple, rendering an easy to read router. 

![app routes](src/img/app-router.png)
[App Code](src/features/routes/app.js)

This is where the magic happens though. We use the private route as a component that composes routes for us. This also lends us the opprotunity to render all of our componenets as children of the navbar which means the page content will be in the correct spot with our permanent drawer and toolbar. 

![private route](src/img/private-route.png)
[Private Route Code](src/features/routes/PrivateRoutes.js)
>Double composition with a conditional render. Doesn't get more React than that. 

### Navigation <a name="navigation"></a>

I again leverage compositon to help create menu list items that are link components/icon buttons.


![private route](src/img/menu-list-obj.png)
[Menu List Icon Code](src/features/routes/DrawListItem.js)

First we compose the object to hold all of the information that we want to be mapped over. This list holds the path, the text for the menu list item, and the icon that we want displayed. 


We map over the Material-Ui components and you can notice a couple things. A conditional background color rendering based on the location of the page. 

[^1]: This is set with the location we are storing in sessions. 
![private route](src/img/menu-list-items.png)


The background will reflect the active page. 
![private route](src/img/menu-list-hover.gif)


>With the power of composition I can easily add a button or a route by adding to the composing objects. This will work for the private routes or the drawer menu list items. 

Here is adding a functional drawer menu list item with a working route and css highlight in less than 10 seconds to highlight this power. 

![private route](src/img/adding-li.gif)


As I mentioned earlier, everything is composed through a private route component and inside of that component it is wrapped in my Navbar. 

![private route](src/img/navbar.png)
[Navbar Code](src/features/routes/Navbar.js)
``` javascript
{children}
```
is our application. 

## Recipes  <a name="recipes"></a>
Alright, now we are back to exploring features. We are now going to add a recipe to our meal plan. We navigated to recipe previews inside of the meal plan container of a user, but we are going to go to the search page and find recipes in this manner. 

### Dynamic Database Search <a name="ddbs"></a>
At the top of the page we have a search bar that encourages a user to search by a keyword in the Title of the recipe. 

![private route](src/img/search-pagination.gif)

[Search Code](src/features/recipes/RecipeIndex.js)

This is doing a dynamic query of the database. Leveraging the citext properties of Rails v6. This also sends back invalid responses that updates the helper text.

![private route](src/img/search-error.gif)

[Search Code](src/features/recipes/RecipeIndex.js)

### Show  <a name="recipe"></a>
No matter the navigation path, a recipe excerpt will lead to the recipe render page. That will render many different components that all deal with the individual recipe data: 
- title
- metadata
- tips 
- ingredients 
- description 
- main image
- instruction, text and image

![private route](src/img/recipe-show.gif)

[Recipe Rendering Code](src/features/recipes/RecipeRender.js)

This is where I had the opprotunity to use multiple components and to give a new interpretation on the data I collected from the Spruce Eats. The clean material components I think really highlight the minimalist theme that showcases the food. One of my 'flavorite' parts is the instruction timeline. I think it turned out really good. 

**Additional Features** Aggrigating the ingredients for a shopping list would be my next feature for the recipes. This would be such a benefit to a meal planning application. 

You can add the recipe to a meal plan by selecting it from the select bar that is on the navigation drawer. A helpful snackbar reminds or alerts us to that. 


[^2]: This is the second instance of using the location to conditionally render the component. The recipe page will trigger the navigation drawer to render the select form.  

Having the select form on the navigation drawer is a deliberate design. As you explore the recipe I wanted the user to be able to add the recipe to the meal plan at any point. 

![private route](src/img/add-recipe.gif)

## Meal Plan Edit <a name="mpe"></a>
As soon as you select a recipe you are directed to the edit page for the meal plan. You can also navigate here through the Dashboard. 

![Meal Plan Navigartion](src/img/edit-meal-plan.gif)

You are greeted with a reminder snack bar, persistence happens on save as you can drag and drop items to your heart's content. 

On the dashboard the meal plan preview populates with the images of the recipes it contains. Giving the user a great sneak peak or reminder. 

![Meal Plan Dashboard](src/img/meal-plan-dash.gif)


### Drag and Drop Editor <a name="dnd"></a>
Here is a demonstration of CRUD actions in the drag and drop editor. 

You can: 
- change the day
- change position in the day
- delete
- all persistent actions

![Meal Plan Editor](src/img/mp-crud.gif)

[Meal Plan Editor](/src/features/user-plans/UserPlansShow.jsx)

The drag and drop is a complex beast that took me multiple days out of my two-week deadline to implement. I am really pleased with the outcome and welcome you to see how I implemented it with React hook and Material-Ui components. 

I used the React Beautiful dnd npm package to help with my zoning. This did not play well with the Material-Ui componenents naturally as you are refencing DOM elements not virtual DOM elements when you implement a drag and drop feature. I worked around this by digging into the Material-Ui documentation. Feel free to explore the code more. 

## Logout <a name="logout"></a>
With logging out we have to make sure to rid the token out of local storage and remove the client from the protected routes, otherwise the fetches will not bring back anything and the app will crash. 

With protected routes though if they are no longer logged in they get pushed to the log-in page. My solution for logging out is like so: 
``` javascript

    const loggingOut = () => {
      window.localStorage.clear();
      window.sessionStorage.clear();
      window.location.reload();
    };
```
I simply clear the storage and reload the window. Letting the protected routing do the redirecting for me. 

![private route](src/img/log-out.gif)

That concludes my demonstration of the availible features.

**Additional Features** The database is set up to have complex sharing and relationships with each user. I think that this would be a great start for sharing between users. "Flavoriting" and having "Flavor Followers" etc. I would implement that after some meal plan functionality like a shopping list. 

Thank you for stopping by. If you have any notes or questions please feel free to reach out.


Footnote: 
[^3]: Redux Toolkit and Rails as an API. DUCK directory design and using the files as Rail views has peaked my interest. I would love to explore creating a generator where the controllers generate a redux slice.
